<h2 style="text-align:center;">Introduction</h2>

<p>My full name is Alexis Bibian Paramo and I am currently a junior at Lewis University studying physics. I was born in Mexico and also spent ten years there. My family is comprised of two of my siblings, older brother and older sister, my mom and myself. We came to the US in 2010 to get away from the increasing violance in Mexico at the time and to also persue higher education. I plan to continue my education after getting my four year degree at Lewis to achieve either a masters or a PhD degree in either astrophysics or particle physics.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">My Favorite Hobby</h2>
<p>I'd like to say my favorite hobby is being productive by either fixing things or researching things that interest me but as of lately I haven't had the motivation to do such things and I've been watching a lot of TV shows. I'd say this is due to winter since the cold affects my moods. During the summer I like to work on my car by either keeping up with the maintenance or adding some things to it. My definition of being productive also stems into engaging in physical activities such as running, lifting weights, boxing and bike riding. Since seasonal changes affect my emotions and they have an affect on my hobbies, my hobbies are in constant cycle throughout the year.</p>
